Ingredients:
 -Flour tortillas (recipe below) -- 8
 -Refried beans -- 2 cups
 -Crumbled queso duro, cotija or feta cheese -- 1/2 cup
 -Mexican-style sour cream (cream agria) -- 1/4 cup

Directions:
  1. Heat an ungreased griddle, comal or skillet over medium flame. Meanwhile, heat up the refried beans in a saucepan, stirring in a little water.
  2. Place a tortilla into the skillet and heat it on both sides to soften it up. Place the tortilla on a serving plate. Smear some refried beans on one half of the tortilla, sprinkle it with some crumbled cheese and drizzle it with a little sour cream. Fold the tortilla in half over the filling.
  3. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and serve hot.
